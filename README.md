# Winner 

This is a small project to do scrum poker in a team. There is a lightweight server that everybody connects to with rooms that allow people to do voting on story points.
The project is called `Winner` as a joke, because I had someone in a team that said that he had won when the storypoints he voted for got chosen, even though that is beside the point ðŸ˜‰

# Usage

TODO add description regarding the usage


# Sub-crates

* `winner_server` Contains the server to connect to
* TODO: `winner_cli` contains the cli interface to communicate with the server
* TODO: `winner_gui` contains a GUI to connect to the server

# Future

* JIRA integration, directly connect to a JIRA project, get stories from there and update stories on JIRA
* Peer2Peer. Investigate maybe using libp2p to do without a server.
